## Task description
Here you can describe what tasks you decided to solve.
> Please provide a short description of your project.

Decided to show how much money you can get out of compounding over several years, with small monthly 
contributions that make all the difference.

## How to run
For example ***yarn start***
> Remember to package all dependencies!

all dependencies should be "packed". If something goes wrong i don't have any other suggestion then to run it in a code editor, write "npm i" in the terminal and let the magic happen. 
afterwards just write "npm run dev" in the terminal and all should be swell.

Afteredit. Problems with loading dependencies. "npm install three gsap" should do the trick. also sending a zip-file just in case

## Comments
Comments regaring design choices, decisions, or anything at all.

would be fun to try more projects with more time to develop whatever the project/challenge is.
Should have made an assessment on how to run it on other systems before handing this in.
